# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Rock Paper Scissors on JavaScript

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game developed on JavaScript.
It is heavily based on one of the activities in Codecademy's JavaScript tutorial.

However, I have added some of my own functionality to it.

I would appreciate any input, as this is my first program and I don't know any of the proper protocols, procedures, etc!


INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply run the script, then choose Rock, Paper, Scissors, or simply hit cancel.
Case is not necessary.

The program will then compare your choice to a choice made by the computer based on a random number generator
and give you a result.

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock

If an incorrect response is put in, the program will ask you to try again.


To Do:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: Create a way to replay the game if a tie is made.

2: Allow for the user to play again.

3: Make the code simpler, and look nicer.
