# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Rock Paper Scissors on JavaScript

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game developed on JavaScript.
It is based on one of the projects in Codecademy's JavaScript tutorial.

However, I have added some of my own functionality to it, such as allowing for incorrect responses to
be entered, and for the game to be played through prompts and confirmations rather than the console.

I would appreciate any input, as this is my first program and I don't know any of the proper protocols, procedures, etc to writing well coded javascript.!

I'm also trying to figure out how to use GitHub.

INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply run the script, then choose Rock, Paper, Scissors, or simply hit cancel.
Case is not necessary.

The program will then compare your choice to a choice made by the computer based on a random number generator
and give you a result.

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock

If an incorrect response is put in, the program will ask you to try again.


To Do:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1: Allow for the user to play again.

2: Make the code simpler, look nicer, and be easier to understand.
